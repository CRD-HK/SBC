# SBC Project (CRD-HK/HKU)

The Single Board Computer (SBCs) project was established in 2019 by the CRD-HK Charity and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) to enable scientists and research institutions to gather autonomous environmental data (ED) at Hong Kong sites.

The role of the CRD-HK team to design and select SBC units that are retrofitted with a range of sophisticated sensors. There are no other universities present that either are developing or have completed this type of project.  

It is proposed that the deployment of SBCs at geographical sites around Hong Kong is scheduled for early 2020. 

Major ED recordings of relevance to any scientific research are the measurements of; 

(1) pH. 
(2) Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP)
(3) Dissolved oxygen (DO). 
(4) Conductivity and/or turbidity.
(5) Windspeed.
(6) Temperature, ambient air, and water.

In this SBC project, the team has set the bar high by utilizing the widely availability of code and components today. The major ED recordings have been expanded with:


(7) Air Quality Sensor.
(8) UV Sensor ML8511.
(9) LoRaWAN Ra-02 SX1278 Module.
(10)Combined Humidity, Temperature & Pressure Sensor.
(11)Tilt Angle MPU6050.
(12)Ultrasonic Sensor (5 meters range).
(13)Flex Solar Panel.

In this GitHub personalized repository, you will find the code and components definition with schematics while updated throughout the project life cycle.
